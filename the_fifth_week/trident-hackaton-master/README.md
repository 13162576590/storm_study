This project is a playground for Storm's Trident. In this project you can find the guideline I used for the Trident hackaton @ Big Data Beers #4 in Berlin: http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Beers/events/112226662/ in the Demo.java file.

You can also find illustrative examples of the concepts I explained in the examples sub-package.
